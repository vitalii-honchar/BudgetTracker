description: Add all changes, commit, and push to origin
---

Add all changed files to git, create a commit, and push to origin.

Follow these steps:
1. Run `git status` to show what will be committed
2. Generate a concise, professional commit message based on the changes (no emojis, should clearly represent what changes were made)
3. Run `git add .` to stage all changes
4. Run `git commit -m "generated message"`
5. Run `git push origin main` (or current branch)
6. Show the result
